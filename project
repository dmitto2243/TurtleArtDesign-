Paragraph 2
</p>To play the game “A Break in Dimensions” you must jump on platforms while avoiding enemies. You have three hearts and if a enemy hits you your heart will go down by one and you can only get it back in the end of the round. In each level there are 20 enemies and in level 5 the devil who wants to take over the world is going to spawn enemies which you have to deal with and even attack you. You can get power up in the game to increase the speed of which you can shoot or the amount of fireballs you can shoot. You have 2 minutes to kill the enemies or you will die but don’t worry there is a power up in the game which would revive you is you die but there is only one so be careful.
